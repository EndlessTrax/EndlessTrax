# 👋 Hi friend!

I'm Ricky and I came into tech from a non-traditional background. I'm an enthusiastic problem solver with passion for creating and building, from software and websites to books and bonsai. I consider myself a lifelong learner and try to learn something new each day.

I'm currently working at [The Migus Group](https://github.com/The-Migus-Group) where I wear multiple hats as the Director of Technology and Operations.

## A few other things about me:

📝 I'm a writer, who has authored both [fiction and non-fiction books](https://rickywhite.net/books).

👨‍⚕️ I used to be a registered nurse. 

🥋 I'm also a [martial artist](https://rickywhite.net/blog/brief-history-of-my-martial-arts-journey), holding the rank of Nidan (second-degree black belt) in Shaolin Kempo.

🌲 I collect and maintain a modest Bonsai collection
