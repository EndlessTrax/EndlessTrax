# 👋 Hello, I'm Ricky!

## Who am I?

I am many thngs to many people

💻 Principally, I’m the owner of [White Lion Media](https://whitelionmedia.com/), a digital content creation company. Primary the company builds and designs websites for individuals and small businesses in need of a web presence so that they can serve their customers and/or grow their business. But we also provide copywriting and consulting services for our clients.

📝 I am also a writer who has authored both [fiction and non-fiction books](https://endlesstrax.com/books), along with countless blog posts and articles on various sites and publications.

👨‍⚕️ I am also the President — and a founding member — of [Walk AS One](https://walkasone.org/), a 501c3 non-profit based in Maine. Walk AS One is *“an all-volunteer organization that mobilizes and motivates a global community to raise awareness and address the challenges of those affected by Ankylosing Spondylitis and its family of related diseases.”* As a patient with Ankylosing Spondylitis, this charity is obviously dear to my heart.

:us: In 2014, my family and I moved from the United Kingdom to the United States. It was at this time that I gave up my career as a registered nurse and became a stay-at-home dad. I used to think that I was underpaid and under-appreciated before; how wrong was I?

🥋 I am also a martial artist, holding the rank of Nidan in Shaolin Kempo. I train as regularly as my schedule allows, and I teach as much as I can. Every time I am in the dojo, I learn something new. I love it! It helps me grow as a person, daily.

🌲 You might be inclined to think that I would be very busy, and you would be right. But one thing I have learned through my nursing and parenting duties is how to manage my time effectively. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t have time to maintain a modest Bonsai collection on top of it all. 

I do all these things, not because I’m bored, or because I have too much time on my hands, but because they enrich me from the inside out. I make it my mission to learn something new each day, and I’m continually looking to improve myself and become the best role model I can for my kids and for those I teach. I put the same dedication and passion into everything I do.
